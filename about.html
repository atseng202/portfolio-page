            <p>I am a full stack software engineer from Los Angeles, California in search of new opportunities.</p>

            <p>I have been passionate about a career in software engineering for quite some time, which came about through curiosity of what friends were knee-deep working on at night and later on, as a hobby to learn in my free time.</p>

            <p>Coming from health care, I was very empathetic to customer needs and have found this quality to be an important aspect of programming. From designing responsive features to making sure genuine needs are addressed, I find these challenges to be both important and fun to work on. I have also been teaching in small classrooms and for students privately from the ages of 10 to 19, and my time with education has been an eye-opener on setting up initial processes with kids, addressing their ongoing questions, and iterating on lessons until they were worthwhile for my students' time.
                I often asked what I could improve on to relay understanding, and educational tools were always available that I could test out. Apps helping with memory retention or platforms gamifying learning objectives all came out of developers addressing everyday problems. These only served to widen my curiosity of the endless tools that I could create with my own hands.
            </p>

            <p>The beauty in this field for me is all the creative people working on lasting work for our world. From frictionless app experiences so our parents and grandparents can stay communicated with us, to tools engaging and educating communities on vital information, there are so many solutions being iterated on that will change our lens of the world drastically. I only wish to serve as a student and learn through these experiences while contributing my small part to these amazing endeavors.</p>
